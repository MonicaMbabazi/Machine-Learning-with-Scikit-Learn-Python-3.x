 `Random forests` or random decision forests are an **ensemble learning method** for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes or mean prediction of the individual trees.
 * Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set.
