### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

A `support vector machine (SVM)` is a **supervised machine learning model** that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they're able to categorize new text. So you're working on a text classification problem.
