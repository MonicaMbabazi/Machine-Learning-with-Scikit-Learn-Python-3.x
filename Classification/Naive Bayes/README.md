The general term Naive Bayes refers the the strong independence assumptions in the model, rather than the particular distribution of each feature. A Naive Bayes model assumes that each of the features it uses are conditionally independent of one another given some class. More formally, if I want to calculate the probability of observing features f1 through fn, given some class c, under the Naive Bayes assumption the following holds:
