# Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Python-3.x

**Defination:** Machine learning is the scientific study of `algorithms` and `statistical models` that `computer systems` use in order to perform a `specific task` effectively `without using explicit instructions`, relying on patterns and inference instead. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.

scikit-learn
============

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the `About us <https://scikit-learn.org/dev/about.html#authors>`__ page

for a list of core contributors.

It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

Installation
===========

Dependencies
-------------
#####  scikit-learn requires:

* Python (>= 3.6)
* NumPy (>= 1.13.3)
* SciPy (>= 0.19.1)
* joblib (>= 0.11)

* **Scikit-learn 0.20 was the last version to support Python 2.7 and Python 3.4.**
* scikit-learn 0.23 and later require Python 3.6 or newer.

Scikit-learn plotting capabilities (i.e., functions start with ``plot_`` and classes end with "Display") require Matplotlib (>= 2.1.1). For running the examples Matplotlib >= 2.1.1 is required. A few examples require scikit-image >= 0.13, a few examples require pandas >= 0.18.0, some examples require seaborn >= 0.9.0.

User installation
------------------
If you already have a working installation of numpy and scipy, the easiest way to install scikit-learn is using ``pip``   ::

    pip install -U scikit-learn

or ``conda``::

    conda install scikit-learn

The documentation includes more detailed `installation instructions <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html>`_.
